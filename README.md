# Enter-Comm

**Enter-Comm** is an Android bike intercom app that creates a mesh network using WiFi Direct for offline voice communication between cyclists. The app enables real-time audio communication over 100-200 meter ranges without internet connectivity.

## Features

- **WiFi Direct Mesh Network**: Creates peer-to-peer connections between devices
- **Real-time Audio Communication**: Voice chat between connected cyclists
- **Offline Operation**: No internet or cellular connection required
- **Mesh Network Topology**: Multi-hop routing for extended range
- **Dynamic Network Healing**: Automatically adapts when devices move in/out of range
- **Battery Optimized**: Designed for long bike rides

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **WiFi Direct Manager**: Handles device discovery, connection, and mesh formation
- **Mesh Network Manager**: Manages multi-hop routing and network topology
- **Audio Streaming**: Thread-safe real-time audio communication system
- **UI Layer**: Jetpack Compose interface for device management and communication controls

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI**: Jetpack Compose
- **Networking**: Android WiFi P2P APIs + IPv6 addressing
- **Audio**: Custom audio processing with planned WebRTC integration
- **Architecture**: MVVM with coroutines for asynchronous operations
